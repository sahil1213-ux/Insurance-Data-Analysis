## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps insurance companies better understand their customers and policy trends. It enables insurers to analyze claim patterns, assess risk factors, and optimize premium pricing. By identifying the key factors influencing claim approvals and rejections, insurers can improve their claim processing efficiency and detect potential fraud.  

Additionally, the dashboard provides insights into customer demographics, policy preferences, and claim frequencies, helping insurers develop data-driven strategies for customer retention. Since many claims are either pending or rejected, insurers must streamline their approval processes and enhance transparency.  

Furthermore, analyzing the relationship between coverage amounts and claim frequencies allows insurers to refine their risk assessment models. By leveraging these insights, insurance companies can enhance their services, reduce fraudulent claims, and improve customer satisfaction.
